# Substack ➡️ Ghost Migration Toolkit

Migration tools for moving from Substack to Ghost


## Migrating content

To migrate posts, use Ghost's official migration tool.

Install the migration tool with NPM:

`npm install --global @tryghost/migrate`


Then run this script, replacing the variables as appropriate.

```bash

# Set an environment variable with the location of your data export.
# Replace the path in quotes ⬇️ with the path to your Substack data.
export WORKDIR="./your_publication-export-20xx-x-x-hash_here"

# ⬇️ Run Ghost migration tool on posts export
# file (Substack phraseology)
migrate substack ${WORKDIR}/posts.csv \

# ⬇️ Set posts directory
--readPosts ${WORKDIR}/posts \

# ⬇️ Run in verbose mode
--verbose \

# ⬇️ Scrape images, etc
--scrape all \

# ⬇️ Current URL of Substack publication
--url your-publication.substack.com \

# ⬇️ Associate the posts with a specific author.
# Defaults to the Ghost "owner" account.
--email author-name@optout.news \

# ⬇️ Import draft posts. Will be saved in Ghost's
# drafts folder.
--drafts true \

# ⬇️ Mutate any current Substack subscribe links,
# replace with Ghost equivalents.
--subscribeLink \#/portal/signup 

```
